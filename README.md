## Welcome to the Audio Network Frontend Test!
<br/>

### Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
<br/><br/>

### Getting Started

First install the dependencies by calling:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server by calling:

```bash
npm start
```

Run the tests by calling:

```bash
npm test
```
<br/>

### Your Task

Extend the app so you can view album details, including track listings, and the composers associated with each track.

Use the following documentation to help you with calls to our Music API: https://test-musicapi.audionetwork.com/docs/

We use TypeScript, and if you would like to as well, you can see how to configure it [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).
